   # Full Stack Framework with Django - GTA Mechanics

GTA Mechanics is a mobile mechanic business. The Mechanics offer services in the greater Toronto area. Services range from tune-ups to vehicle inspections. Customers can go on the website and create an account, or use the service as a guest. For the customers who have created an account they can see their order(s) and view the before and after images of the work that is done on their vehicle. The mechanics upload images before they start working on the customers vehicle, once they have completed their work they upload the after image.
